## Getting Sass to make the CSS
1. [Get Sass installed!](https://sass-lang.com/install). I recommend the last thing on the page: using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on a Mac, and running `brew install sass/sass/sass`
2. Then, you can navigate to the style folder `cd style`, and run `sass --watch stylesheet.scss stylesheet.css`
3. Your command line now is running a program that will translate the `.scss` file to a `.sass` file. Set it and forget it!
